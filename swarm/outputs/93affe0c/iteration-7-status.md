Node: switched to v20.19.5 via nvm (>=20.9.0).
Tests: `npm run test:run` passed (46 tests). Initial `npm run test --if-present` started vitest in watch; stopped.
Build: `npm run build` succeeded.
Lint: `npm run lint` completed with warnings only (unused eslint-disable in convex/_generated, next/no-img-element warning in `UserAvatar.tsx`).
Playwright E2E: NOT RUN. Dev server not started because tool policy forbids running long-lived `npm run dev` processes; localhost:3000 not responding.
