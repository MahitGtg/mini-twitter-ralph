# Iteration 9 coder update

## Completed
- Fixed invalid tweet ID handling in `mini-twitter/src/app/tweet/[tweetId]/page.tsx` to avoid client exception and show not-found UI.
- Applied tweet detail UI refactors:
  - Styled `← Back` as a button with hover affordance.
  - Increased spacing between heading and tweet card.
- Applied profile "Who to follow" alignment refactor by tightening compact `UserCard` alignment in `mini-twitter/src/components/user/UserCard.tsx`.
- Marked refactor todo complete by renaming `verify/refactor/tweet-detail-page.md` -> `verify/refactor/tweet-detail-page.done.md`.
- Updated `swarm/todo/verify-tweet-detail-page.pending.md` with a `Fixes applied` section.

## Verification
- `cd mini-twitter && npm run test:run` passed.
- Re-ran previously failing E2E flow (invalid tweet ID) using playwright-cli against localhost and confirmed:
  - "Tweet not found" text present
  - "← Back" link present
  - Screenshot saved to `/tmp/tweet-detail-not-found-rerun.png`
