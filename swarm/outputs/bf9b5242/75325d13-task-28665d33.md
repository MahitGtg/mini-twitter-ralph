## Task Result

- Iteration: 1/10
- Agent: `75325d13`
- Task: `28665d33`

## Bugs fixed

- Fixed wrong-password sign-in error leakage in `mini-twitter/src/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx`.
- Raw backend/provider errors are no longer shown to users during sign-in.
- Credential-related failures now return: `Invalid email or password.`
- Other sign-in failures return: `Unable to sign in.`

## Refactors applied

- None. No files found in `verify/refactor/` (excluding `.done.md`).

## Verification

- Ran: `cd mini-twitter && npm run test:run`
- Result: PASS (all test files and tests passing in this run)
- Playwright rerun of previously failing flow could not be executed in this session because local app server was unavailable at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

## Updated pipeline artifacts

- Updated pending task file with `Fixes applied`:
  - `swarm/todo/verify-auth-page-routes.pending.md`
